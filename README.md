# pidcontroller

April 2022: This repo has now been superseded by separate repos for each of the experiments, to make it easier to keep track of separate developments. For example, the spinning disk controller has had a motor upgrade to reduce variability, but the governor and digger have not (variability arising from the friction in the nidec motor is quite useful to demonstrate real world effects).

Firmware can now be found as follows (in the `./fw` subdirectory):

  - Spinning Disk (AMAX version 2022) [github.com/practable/spinner-amax-firmware](https://github.com/practable/spinner-amax) 
  - Spinning Disk (Nidec version 2021) [github.com/practable/spinner-nidec](https://github.com/practable/spinner-nidec) 
  - Governor (Nidec version 2021) [github.com/practable/governor-nidec](https://github.com/practable/governor-nidec) 
  - Digger (Nidec version 2021) [github.com/practable/digger-nidec](https://github.com/practable/digger-nidec)
