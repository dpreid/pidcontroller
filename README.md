# pidcontroller

MotorController contains the base motor controls for driving the motor forwards and backwards at certain speeds (input 0-255). The speed of the motor is currently limited for testing by the code.

the 'examples' folder contains the PIDMotorController code itself. Current example commands are given in the SerialCommands text file.
